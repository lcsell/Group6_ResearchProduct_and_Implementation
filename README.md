# Group6_ResearchProduct_and_Implementation

This repository contains two folders, Research Product and Implementation.

Research Product contains a presentation (including an appendix of resources) and code sample for a Naïve Bayes machine learning model.

Implementation contains a Jupyter Notebook for our XGBoost (including data processing steps, an unmodified and modified XGBoost model and a Naïve Bayes model 
for comparison) and a brief presentation on the contents of the Notebook.

Thank you for reading.
